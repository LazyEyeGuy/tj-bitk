# tj-bitk
The TJ Bioinformatics Toolkit (BITK) is software designed to aid in various forms of bioinformatics. This program was designed as a part of the 2018 Thomas Jefferson Biocode event.

# Instructions
This software is designed to take a plaintext file (like a .txt file) containing a DNA sequence (e.g. cgatcgtatgctgcggattcgatgcatgatc) and turn it into both RNA sequences and protein strings. To use, make a text file and fill it with DNA. The programs is currently only source code, so go into the code and change the file path in the PathFile.Path.java file. Then simply compile and run the Main.java file.
